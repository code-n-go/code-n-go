### About Me

I've been developing in Go since late 2013 and I absolutely love the language.  Of course, there will always be room for improvement; however, no other language I've utilized in my "toolbelt" has fit my needs and expectations more than Go.

### My Go Philosophies

1.  Make the code work.
2.  Make the code efficient (completes in the least amount of time as possible, using the least amount of allocations).
3.  NEVER create or utilize a 3rd-party package/library that PANICS (pass an error and let the user/developer decide how to handle it).
4.  Adapt to and utilize the standard library as much as possible (limit outside dependencies).
5.  Vet ALL 3rd-party packages/libraries (in any event that you can't use the standard library).
6.  Construct great tests (be specific in scope and do not include waste conditions).
7.  Write great documentation (no developer likes to do this, but it is necessary).
8.  Never stop learning (if you think you know Go [or any language] to its fullest, then you don't truly know that language).
